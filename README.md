mdn-samples
===========

This is a live sample server for MDN, which I hope we will be able to use to host content that only works when on a less restrictive environment than running in an iframe on Kuma.

The ''s'' directory contains a folder for each project that needs to be available. Each one has a manifest and whatever files that service requires.
